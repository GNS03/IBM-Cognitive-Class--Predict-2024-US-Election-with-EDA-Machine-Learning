Predicting the 2024 US Presidential Elections: Insights, Challenges, and Data-Driven Strategies
Estimated time needed: 60 minutes

The 2024 US Presidential Elections are anticipated to be one of the most consequential in recent history. Leveraging data from past elections, we aim to build predictive models that give us insights into potential outcomes. In this tutorial, we'll explore how historical polling data can guide our forecasts, discuss the limitations of such predictions, and experiment with various modeling techniques to see what works best.

>**Disclaimer**: This tutorial is not political in nature; it only uses the upcoming U.S. presidential election purely as an educational example for teaching machine learning and data science concepts. 

Our prediction target is the vote share for each candidate, which is the estimated percentage of votes each candidate (Democratic, Republican, or Independent) is expected to receive. Key features influencing this prediction include whether thereâ€™s an incumbent, party affiliation (Democratic, Republican, or Independent), historical voting trends and others.

## Overview of the approach
We'll analyze polling trends from past election cycles, incorporate additional features to capture recent dynamics, and explore different machine learning models to predict state-by-state outcomes.

# Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

1. **Understand the context of polling data**  
   - Explain the limitations of polling data as indicators of public sentiment rather than definitive predictors of election outcomes.
   - Highlight the importance of accounting for the unique political landscape of each swing state.
     

2. **Use feature engineering for enhanced predictions**  
   
3. **Design a regression-based prediction strategy**  
   - Develop a regression-based approach that predicts election outcomes for each polling observation individually.

4. **Train and test models with proper time segmentation**  
   - Ensure models are trained on data from past election cycles and tested on unseen future cycles to prevent data leakage.
   - Apply time-based weighting with an exponential decay function to prioritize recent polling data.

5. **Implement a strategy for 2024 prediction**  
   - Train the best-performing model for each state using data from all election cycles up to 2020.
   - Use the trained models to predict vote shares and the winning candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election, with adjustments to account for the most recent campaign events and trends.

6. **Explore alternative approaches and enhancements**  
   - Consider using ensemble models, classification approaches, economic indicators, and social media sentiment to enhance predictive accuracy.
   - Experiment with different feature engineering techniques, evaluation metrics, and decay functions for more robust predictions.
